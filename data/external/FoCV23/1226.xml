Sub-basal sheaths of flowering culms with blades; blades of vegetative culms herbaceous, linear, shorter than culm, 5–7 mm wide, glabrous, midvein and 2 lateral veins slightly prominent, ligule up to 1 mm. Flowering culms 50–65 cm tall, with spikes at nodes above middle; involucral bract sheaths hardly inflated above, glabrous, blades nearly equaling to slightly longer than sheath. Spikes androgynous, single to ternate at each node, linear-cylindric, 2–5 cm; male part of spike nearly equaling female part, densely flowered; female part loosely 3–7-flowered; peduncles 3–10 cm, slender, exserted, slightly nodding.

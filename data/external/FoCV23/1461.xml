Leaves shorter or longer than culm, blades 3–5 mm wide, plicate proximally and flattened distally, sheathed. Involucral bracts leaflike, longer than spike, not sheathed or lowermost involucral bract shortly sheathed. Spikes 4 or 5; terminal 2 or 3 spikes male, narrowly cylindric, 1.5–4 cm, subsessile; remaining spikes female, remote, oblong-cylindric or broadly cylindric, 2–5 × 1–1.2 cm, densely many flowered, shortly pedunculate. Female glumes brown, lanceolate, ca. 4 mm, membranous, green costate, apex acuminate, muticous or mucronate. Utricles stramineous or sometimes slightly brown, obliquely patent, eventually divergent, longer than glume, ovate, inflated trigonous, ca. 5 mm, membranous, glabrous, shiny, 5-veined abaxially, base rounded, apex abruptly contracted into a medium-sized beak, orifice rather long 2-toothed, teeth slightly recurved.

  <description>Rhizome short, stoloniferous. Culms tufted, 30–75 cm tall, triquetrous, rather thick, smooth on lower part, scabrous on upper part, ferruginous and bladeless sheathed at base, sheaths later usually splitting into reticulate fibers. Leaves longer than culm, blades 3–4 mm wide, flat, stiff, sheathed. Involucral bracts leafy, longer than inflorescence, lowermost involucral bract shortly sheathed, upper ones nearly not sheathed. Spikes 5–7; terminal 2–4 spikes male, approximate, linear-cylindric, 2–3 cm, subsessile; remaining spikes female, rather remote, lowermost distance up to 12 cm, densely many flowered, lowermost spike rather long pedunculate, upper ones shortly pedunculate, peduncles glabrous. Female glumes red-brown laterally, yellow-green at middle, lanceolate, 3–3.5 mm, membranous, 3-veined, apex acuminate, aristate, awn up to 3 mm at base of spike, scabrous on margins. Utricles brown, obliquely patent, horizontally patent in maturity, longer than or equaling glume, shorter than glume at base of spike (including awn), oblong-ovate, trigonous, 4–5 mm, leathery, densely pubescent, 5-veined abaxially, base abruptly contracted into a short stipe, apex gradually narrowed to a slightly thick and short beak, orifice long 2-toothed. Nutlets stramineous, tightly enveloped, obovate or subelliptic, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, apex mucronate; style of medium length, base not thickened; stigmas 3.</description>

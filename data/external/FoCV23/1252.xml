Female glumes dark purple-red, lanceolate or oblong, 4–5 mm, green 1-veined costa forming a mucro or not at apex. Utricles dark purple-red, pale at base, longer than glume, elliptic or ovate, compressed trigonous, 5–6 mm, papery, glabrous, nerveless, base rounded, with a very short stipe, upper margins slightly scabrous, apex abruptly contracted into a short beak, orifice hyaline, obliquely truncate, 2-toothed.

  <description>Rhizome with rather thick stolons. Culms 30–60 cm tall, stiff, triquetrous, smooth, clothed with dark red or red-brown bladeless sheaths at base, remnant sheaths usually disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Leaves shorter than culm, blades 3–4 mm wide, flat, stiff, with distinct transverse septate nodes between veins, sheathed. Involucral bracts leafy, lower ones longer than inflorescence, upper ones nearly not sheathed, lowermost involucral bract shortly sheathed. Spikes 5–7; terminal 2–4 spikes male, distance between spikes short, linear-cylindric, 2–5 cm, nearly sessile; remaining spikes female, remote, cylindric, 2.5–5 × 0.8–1 cm, densely many flowered, upper ones shortly pedunculate, lower one long pedunculate. Female glumes pale, lanceolate, ca. 5 mm, membranous, 3-veined, apex acuminate, shortly aristate. Utricles stramineous, usually dark red flecked, obliquely patent, longer than glume, oblong-ovate, inflated trigonous, 5–6.5 mm, leathery, glabrous, several veined, base rounded, apex gradually narrowed to a slightly broad and medium-sized beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets slightly loosely enveloped, obovate or ovate, trigonous, ca. 3 mm, base stipitate; style slightly thick, stiff; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Apr–Jun.</description>

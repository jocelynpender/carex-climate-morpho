Leaves basal and cauline, slightly exceeding culms, flat, 2–3.5 mm wide, hispid when young; persistent sheaths reddish purple, margins fibrillose. Involucral bracts leafy, slightly longer than inflorescence branches, long sheathed. Panicle compound, 18–36 cm; inflorescence branches linear, 4–15 × 3–6 cm, 2–4 per node; peduncles of inflorescence branches stiff, bluntly trigonous; inflorescence axes trigonous, hairy; bractlets with conspicuous long filiform points; cladoprophylls utriculiform, without a flower, several veined and hairy abaxially. Spikes few, bisexual, androgynous, arising from cladoprophylls, suberect, 5–12 mm; male part of spike nearly as long as female part; male glumes pale brownish white, with dense brown spots and short lines, lanceolate to oblong-elliptic, 2.4–3.5 mm, membranous, obtuse, mucronate; anthers ca. 2 mm; female glumes ovate, 1.5–2.5 mm, membranous, glabrous, obtusely emarginate, mucronate. Utricles whitish green, with chestnut-brown spots, suberect at maturity, slightly longer than body of glumes, narrowly elliptic, trigonous, inflated, 2.4–2.9 mm, distal part sparsely hairy, sessile, apex attenuate into a beak ca. 1/3 length of utricle, hispid, orifice distinctly 2-toothed.

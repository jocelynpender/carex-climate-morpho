Culms arising from axils of leaves, 20–50 cm tall, slender, obtusely trigonous, smooth, clothed at base with fibrous remains of old basal leaf sheaths. Leaves slightly shorter than or nearly equaling culm, blades 2–4(–5) mm wide, flat, glabrous, margins scabrid. Involucral bracts with blades, longer than subtending spike, sheathed, sheath 0.5–2.5 cm. Spikes 4 or 5, upper spikes contiguous, lower ones spaced; terminal spike male, linear-cylindric, 10–20 × 1.5–2 mm, sessile or shortly pedunculate, surpassing next female spikelet; lateral spikes female, linear-cylindric, 15–28 × 2–2.5 mm, densely flowered, with peduncle enclosed in involucral bract sheath or shortly exserted. Female glumes yellow-white, oblong, 2.5–3 mm, with 1-veined green costa, apex cuneate, mucronate. Utricle pale green, longer than glume, rhombic-oblong, obtusely trigonous, ca. 3 mm, thinly membranous, glabrous, many veined, apex gradually attenuate into a conic beak, beak ca. 0.5 mm, minutely 2-toothed at orifice.

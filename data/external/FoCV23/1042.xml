  <description>Rhizome long creeping. Culms erect, 20–60 cm tall, acutely trigonous, scabrous below inflorescence, clothed at base with purple bladeless sheaths often disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Leaves nearly equaling culm, blades linear, 2–3 mm wide, flat, margins revolute. Lowest involucral bract setaceous or leafy, upper ones glumelike. Spikes 3 or 4, approximate; terminal spike with female flowers in middle and male flowers at apex and base; lateral spikes female, ovate-oblong, 1–1.5 cm, subsessile. Female glumes purple-brown, green at middle, narrowly ovate-lanceolate, 4–4.5 mm (including awn), margins white hyaline, 1-veined costa forming short awn at apex, apex acuminate. Utricles light gray-green, shorter than glume, elliptic, compressed trigonous, 2.5–3.5 mm, subleathery, densely papillose, many veined, base contracted into a short stipe, apex abruptly narrowed into a very short beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets loosely enveloped, subobovate, trigonous, ca. 1.8 mm; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Mar.</description>

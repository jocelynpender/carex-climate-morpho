  <description>Rhizome with stolons. Culms 40–60 cm tall, slightly thick, acutely triquetrous, scabrous on upper angles, basal sheaths usually disintegrated into fibers. Leaves nearly equaling culm, blades 4–8 mm wide, flat, rather stiff, scabrous on margins, sheathed. Involucral bracts leaflike, lower involucral bracts nearly equaling subtending spike, upper involucral bract shorter than subtending spike. Spikes 4–6, lowermost spike remote, upper spikes rather approximate; terminal spike male, cylindric, 4–7 cm, pedunculate; lateral spikes female, cylindric, 2–7.5 cm, densely many flowered, lower spikes long pedunculate, upper spikes subsessile. Female glumes red-brown, ovate-lanceolate, ca. 3 mm, membranous, green 1-veined, apex acuminate, mucronate or aristate, scabrous on awn. Utricles greenish yellow, longer than glume, obliquely patent, elliptic, trigonous, ca. 3 mm, papery, glabrous, 5–7-veined, base attenuate, apex abruptly contracted into a medium-sized to long beak, beak slightly recurved, upper part red-brown, obliquely truncate and later shortly 2-toothed at orifice. Nutlets dark brown, slightly loosely enveloped, broadly obovate or subelliptic, trigonous, ca. 1.7 mm; style base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Apr–Jul.</description>

Female glumes white or pale green, ovate, 1.2–1.5 mm, papery, 1-costate and laterally few veined, margins narrowly membranous, apex rounded or obtuse. Utricles pale green, longer than glume, ovate-elliptic, compressed trigonous, 2–2.5 mm, papery, loosely pubescent and ciliate, distinctly 2-veined laterally and thinly few veined, base cuneate, nearly estipitate, apex attenuate into an indistinct short beak, orifice obliquely truncate. Nutlets dark brown at maturity, ovate-oblong, trigonous, sides slightly concave, 1–1.5 mm, base cuneate, nearly estipitate, apex with a slightly recurved beak; style rather inflated, slightly compressed, densely brown granular-punctate; stigmas 3.

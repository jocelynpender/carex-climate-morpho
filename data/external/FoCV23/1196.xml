  <description>Rhizome short. Culms densely tufted, 10–30 cm tall, not up to 1.5 mm thick, compressed triquetrous, smooth. Leaves rather shorter than culm, scabrous and involute on margins, linear, slightly stiff, blades 0.8–1 mm wide, dark brown and persistent sheathed at base, sheaths eventually disintegrating into fibers. Involucral bracts spathelike, sheaths green abaxially and purple-red adaxially, white hyaline on margins, lowermost one with setaceous involucral bract leaf, upper ones without leaf. Spikes 2–4, lowermost spike remote, others approximate; terminal spike male, taller than adjacent female spike, cylindric, 8–10 mm, densely many flowered; lateral spikes 1–3, female, subcylindric, 7–20 mm, densely 4–10- or more flowered; peduncles short, usually not exserted or slightly exserted from involucral bract sheath. Female glumes purple-brown laterally, green at middle, oblong, 4.5–5 mm, papery, 3-veined, margins broadly white hyaline, apex acute, shortly awned. Utricle slightly shorter than glume, obovate-oblong, obtusely trigonous, 3.5–4 mm, papery, densely pubescent, 2-veined laterally and thinly several veined, base gradually narrowed to a short stipe, apex contracted into a recurved and short beak or nearly beakless, orifice truncate. Nutlets brown at maturity, obovate-elliptic, obtusely trigonous, 3–3.2 mm, slightly concave on 3 faces, base shortly stipitate or nearly estipitate, apex with recurved and short beak; style rather short, base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Apr–Aug.</description>

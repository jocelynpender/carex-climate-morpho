  <description>Rhizome with slightly thick stolons. Culms 45–60 cm tall, slightly thick, acutely triquetrous, scabrous on upper part, dark red-brown and bladeless sheathed at base, sheaths later usually splitting into reticulate fibers. Leaves longer than or equaling culm, blades 3–7 mm wide, flat, scabrous on adaxial surface and margins, with indistinctly transverse septate nodes between veins, long sheathed. Involucral bracts leafy, nearly equaling culm, not sheathed, sometimes lowermost involucral bract shortly sheathed. Spikes 4 or 5; terminal spike male, rarely male spikes 2, 3–4.5 cm, 2–3 mm thick; lateral spikes female, remote, distance between uppermost female spike and male spike 3.5–15 cm, female spikes 1.5–4.5 cm, 4–5 mm thick, densely many flowered, upper spike subsessile, lowermost spike shortly pedunculate. Female glumes brownish laterally, greenish at middle, slightly red-brown on upper part, ovate or ovate-lanceolate, 4–6 mm (including awn), membranous, 1–3-veined, margins white hyaline, apex acuminate, aristate or mucronate, scabrous on margins of awn or mucro. Utricles gray-brown, obliquely patent, equaling or slightly shorter than glume, oblong-ovate, slightly inflated trigonous, ca. 4 mm, membranous, hispid, 5-veined, base abruptly contracted, subrounded, shortly stipitate, apex gradually narrowed to a long and slightly broad beak, beak scabrous on margins, 2-toothed and red-brown at orifice. Nutlets tightly enveloped, obovate, trigonous, 1.5–1.8 mm, apex curved mucronate; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 3, slightly long. Fl. and fr. Apr–May.</description>

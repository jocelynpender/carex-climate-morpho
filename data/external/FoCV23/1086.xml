  <description>Rhizome rather long, creeping or obliquely ascending. Culms densely tufted, 10–15 cm tall, nearly half-terete, smooth, several brown and old leaves and sheaths usually disintegrating into fibers. Leaves shorter than culm, not up to 1 mm wide, usually involute into needle-shape, smooth, brown and membranous sheathed. Involucral bracts scale-shaped, lanceolate, long aristate at apex, longer than or slightly shorter than spike, not sheathed. Spikes 2–4, congregate at top of culm; terminal spike male, narrowly lanceolate, 8–15 mm, sessile; lateral spikes female, ovate, 5–8(–10) mm, densely several flowered, subsessile. Female glumes dark brown, ovate, 3.5–4 mm, membranous, with 1-veined yellowish costa, hyaline on upper margin, apex acute, mucronate. Utricles dark brown, suberect or slightly obliquely patent, shorter than or equaling glume, ovate, obtusely trigonous, 3.5–4 mm, thinly leathery, shiny, indistinctly veined, base cuneate, shortly stipitate, apex abruptly contracted into a short beak, orifice very shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets brownish yellow, subelliptic, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, sessile, apex mucronate; style short, base slightly thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Jun–Aug.</description>

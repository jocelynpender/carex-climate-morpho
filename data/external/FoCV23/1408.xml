Leaves longer or shorter than culm, blades broadly linear, 7–8 mm wide, flat, leathery, apex acuminate. Involucral bracts shortly bladed, shorter than inflorescence, long sheathing. Spikes 3, distant; terminal spike male (occasionally with 1 to few female flowers at base), linear, 4–5 cm, with peduncles 5.5–6.5 cm, scabrous; lateral spikes female (or bearing a short male part at apex), cylindric, 2.7–4 cm, loosely flowered. Female glumes pale, oblong, 4.5–5 mm, green 3-veined costa forming a short mucro at apex. Utricles yellow-green, longer than glume, 9–10 mm, pubescent, many veined, base cuneate, apex gradually narrowed to a long beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets tightly enveloped, oblong, ca. 3 mm, obtusely trigonous, constricted on angles at middle, base stipitate, apex abruptly contracted into a cylindric beak, beak expanding into a discoid-annulate orifice; style base thickened; stigmas 3.

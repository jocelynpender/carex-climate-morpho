Leaves shorter than or nearly equaling culm, blades 4–5 mm wide, ± stiff, scabrous on midrib of abaxial surface and margins, long sheathed; sheaths most up to 11 cm, membranous part of sheaths eventually disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Involucral bracts sheathed, lowest involucral bract blade leaflike, upper blades needle-shaped or setaceous, shorter than inflorescence, scabrous near apex. Spike numerous, 1–3 in an involucral bract sheath, usually 2 or 3 racemes composed of several spikes borne in lower involucral bract sheaths, terminal spike male, remaining spikes androgynous, male part much shorter than female part, densely many flowered, linear-cylindric, 10–28 mm, thinly pedunculate. Female glumes yellowish brown, broadly ovate, ca. 2.5 mm, membranous, green 1-costate, white hyaline on apex, apex obtuse or acute, muticous. Utricles green-yellow, suberect, longer than glume, elliptic, plano-convex, ca. 3 mm, white hispidulous on upper part, thinly 9–11-veined, base abruptly contracted into a short stipe, apex abruptly contracted into a short beak less than 1 mm, orifice slightly splitting into 2 teeth.

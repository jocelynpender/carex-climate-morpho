  <description>Rhizome woody, rigid, stoloniferous. Culms tufted, 20–45 cm tall, slender, obtusely trigonous, smooth, clothed at base with dark brown sheaths eventually disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Leaves longer than culm, blades pale green, linear, 3–5 mm wide, flat, slightly rigid, margins scabrous. Involucral bracts reduced to shortly bladed, sheathing 8–15 mm, lowest one setaceous. Spikes 4 or 5; terminal spike male, larger, clavate, 3–5 × 0.3–0.5 cm, with short peduncle; lateral spikes female, distant, narrowly cylindric, 2–5 × 0.4–0.5 cm, densely many flowered, subloosely flowered at base. Female glumes red-brown, obovate-oblong, ca. 3.5 mm, margins narrowly white hyaline, 1-veined costa ending in a mucro, apex truncate or emarginate. Utricles yellow-green and ferruginous, longer than glume, ovate or narrowly elliptic, trigonous, 4.2–4.5 mm, membranous, densely hispid, base gradually attenuate into stipe ca. 1 mm, apex abruptly contracted into beak 1.2–1.8 mm, orifice obliquely truncate, 2-toothed. Nutlets pale brown, tightly enveloped, ovate, trigonous, 1.5–2 mm; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 3.</description>

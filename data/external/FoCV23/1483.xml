  <description>Rhizome thick and short, ligneous, without stolons. Culms tufted, 60–80 cm tall, slightly slender, stiff, obtusely trigonous, with brown and bladeless sheaths at base. Leaves rather dense, upper leaves longer than culm, lower ones rather short, blades 5–6 mm wide, revolute on margins, with transverse septate nodes between veins on abaxial surface; sheaths rather long, overlapping, purple-red and ligulate at sheath mouth. Involucral bracts leaflike, longer than inflorescence, sheathed. Spikes 6–9, upper spikes approximate, lower spikes rather remote; terminal spike male, narrowly cylindric, 2–3 cm, shortly pedunculate; lateral spikes female, cylindric, 2–3 cm, densely many flowered, shortly pedunculate. Female glumes pale yellow, shortly ferruginous striate, broadly ovate, ca. 1.8 mm, membranous, green 1-veined, apex acute. Utricles yellowish green, shortly ferruginous striate, suberect, longer than glume, broadly obovate, obtusely trigonous, ca. 3 mm, membranous, densely white hispidulous, distinctly 2-veined laterally, base abruptly narrowed to a short stipe, apex abruptly narrowed to a rather short beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets tightly enveloped in utricle, broadly elliptic, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, base abruptly narrowed to a short stipe, apex acute; style short, base slightly thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Jun–Sep.</description>

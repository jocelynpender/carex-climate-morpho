  <description>Rhizome long creeping, stout, indurate, clothed at base with brown glumelike sheaths disintegrating into fibers. Culms 6–100 cm tall, stout or slender, acutely trigonous, scabrous, with bladeless sheaths at base. Leaves shorter than culm, blades linear, 1–5 mm wide, flat, apex acuminate. Involucral bracts glumelike. Spicate inflorescence cylindric, usually interrupted, 1.8–7.5 × 0.7–1.3 cm; spikes ovate or oblong, 5–12 × 4–6 mm, upper and lower spikes usually androgynous, middle ones male, lower spikes entirely female. Female glumes pale yellow-brown, ovate, 2.2–3 × 1–1.5 mm, green 1-veined, margins broadly white hyaline. Utricles pale yellow-green, longer than glume, broadly ovate or oblong, plano-convex, 3.5–4 × 1.5–2 mm, membranous, sparsely pilose on both faces, rather densely so above, and usually verruculose, abaxially conspicuously 8–10-veined, adaxially 3–5-veined toward base, base rounded, shortly stipitate, margins broadly serrulate winged, apex gradually narrowed into a beak, beak compressed, deeply 2-toothed at orifice. Nutlets tightly enveloped, ovate or elliptic, plano-convex, 1.5–2 mm, base brown, cuneate or rounded, shortly stipitate; stigmas 2. Fl. and fr. Jun–Aug.</description>

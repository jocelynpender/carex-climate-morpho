  <description>Rhizome rather thick, ligneous, clothed with sheaths, sheaths usually disintegrating into fibers. Culms tufted, 30–70 cm tall, obtusely trigonous, smooth. Leaves basal, equaling or shorter than culm, blades (3–)5–7 mm wide, flat, scabrous on both surfaces and margins, sheathed. Lower involucral bracts leaflike, sheaths up to 3 cm, upper blades of involucral bracts setaceous, shortly sheathed, sheaths only 2–3 mm. Spikes 8–10 or more, usually 1–3 in an involucral bract sheath, lower spikes remote, upper spikes ± contiguous; terminal spike male, linear; lateral spikes female, cylindric, 3–6 cm, loosely many flowered. Female glumes deciduous earlier than utricles, pale, lanceolate-ovate, ca. 3 mm, membranous, 1-veined, hispid on vein, apex mucronate or aristate. Utricles yellowish green, longer than glume, horizontally patent at maturity, elliptic-ovate, plano-convex, ca. 6 mm, papery, shiny, 5-veined abaxially, base broadly cuneate, apex gradually narrowed to a long beak, orifice thinly membranous, shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets loosely enveloped, elliptic, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, base stipitate; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. May–Jun.</description>

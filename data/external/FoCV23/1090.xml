  <description>Rhizome rather long, obliquely ascending, slender stoloniferous. Culms loosely tufted, 10–20 cm tall, slender, acutely triquetrous, smooth, red-brown and bladeless sheathed at base, rudimentary sheaths usually disintegrating into fibers. Leaves shorter than or nearly equaling culm, blades 1–2 mm wide, flat, scabrous on upper surface and margins; sheaths yellowish, distinctly many veined, veins sometimes pallid or reddish. Involucral bracts shortly sheathed, lowest involucral bract leaflike, upper ones setiform. Spikes 2 or 3, rather approximate, congregated at top of culm; terminal spike male, clavate-linear or oblong, 0.8–1.2 cm, subsessile; lateral spikes female, ovate or subelliptic, 5–12 mm, loosely few to several flowered, lowest spike with slender peduncle, upper with very short peduncle or subsessile. Female glumes yellowish brown or brown, ovate, ca. 3 mm, membranous, with broad midrib, apex acute. Utricles stramineous in upper part and brownish on basal surface, obliquely patent, equaling or slightly longer than glume, obovate, obtusely trigonous, 3–3.5 mm, leathery, hispidulous, rather dense on upper part, with 2 distinct lateral veins abaxially, base cuneate, apex abruptly contracted into a short beak, orifice truncate and membranous. Nutlets yellow, elliptic or obovate-elliptic, trigonous, 2.5–2.8 mm, apex mucronate; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Jun–Sep.</description>

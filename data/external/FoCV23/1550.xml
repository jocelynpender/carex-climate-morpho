Leaves shorter than culm, blades broadly linear, 6–8 mm wide, flat, stiff. Involucral bracts leaflike, surpassing inflorescence, sheathless. Spikes 4–9, narrowly cylindric, 5–10 cm, densely many flowered, upper spikes approximate, lower 1 or 2 slightly distant, with peduncles, pendent; upper 1–4 spikes gynaecandrous (rarely male at apex); remaining spikes female. Female glumes dark sanguineous, subobovate, green 3-veined costa excurrent into a scabrous awn at truncate or 2-lobed apex. Utricles yellow-green, subequaling glume, suberect, broadly ovate or subovate, plano-convex, ca. 3 mm, membranous, minutely papillose, nerveless except for 2 costas on edges, base shortly stipitate, apex abruptly contracted into a slender pale beak, orifice emarginate, often scabrous.

Culms tufted, 30–75 cm tall, acutely trigonous, slender, scabrous, clothed at base with reddish brown, slightly lustrous, bladeless sheaths disintegrating into fibers. Leaves subequaling culm, blades linear, ca. 2 mm wide, flat, margins scabrous. Lowest involucral bract leaflike, equaling or longer than inflorescence, sheathless. Spikes 3–5; upper 1 or 2 spikes male, narrowly cylindric, 0.8–2.5 cm, terminal spike with peduncle; remaining spikes female, occasionally some becoming androgynous and bearing several male flowers at apex, oblong to narrowly cylindric, 10–30 × 3–4 mm, densely many flowered, with short peduncles or subsessile. Female glumes purple-black, narrowly elliptic, 1.5–2 mm, green 1–3-veined at middle, scabrous on veins, margins narrowly white hyaline, apex obtuse. Utricles light green, longer than and much broader than glume, elliptic, rarely obovate or suborbicular, plano-convex, (1.8–)2.2–3 mm, densely minutely papillose, veined, apex abruptly contracted into a short beak, orifice emarginate.

  <description>Rhizome slightly elongate, ligneous, clothed with dark brown sheaths eventually disintegrating into fibers. Culms tufted or loosely tufted, 10–70 cm tall, rather thin, triquetrous, smooth on lower part, scabrous on upper part. Leaves basal, much shorter than culm, blades 2–4 mm wide, flat, scabrous on both surfaces and margins; sheaths less than 2 cm, usually splitting. Involucral bracts sheathed, lower involucral bracts leaflike, upper ones setaceous, uppermost 1 or 2 nearly bladeless; sheaths 0.5–4.5 cm. Spikes 3–5, single in an involucral bract sheath, remote, spaced up to 18 cm, upper spikes rather contiguous, usually not branched, androgynous, cylindric, 2–4 cm, with few male flowers on upper part, sparsely with more than 10 female flowers on lower part; lower spikes long pedunculate, upper spikes shortly pedunculate. Female glumes yellowish green, ovate-lanceolate, 3.5–5 mm, membranous, several veined, midrib slightly thick, apex acuminate, aristate, scabrous on awn. Utricles greenish, obliquely patent, longer than glume, elliptic or broadly elliptic, plano-convex, 5–6 mm, membranous, glabrous, 5–9-veined abaxially, base cuneate, apex gradually narrowed into a slightly long beak, beak ca. 2.5 mm, scabrid on margins, 2-toothed at orifice. Nutlets stramineous, tightly enveloped, broadly elliptic, compressed plano-convex, ca. 2.5 mm, base shortly stipitate; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 2. Fl. and fr. Jun–Aug.</description>

  <description>Rhizome slender, creeping. Culms densely tufted, slender, 30–40 cm tall, compressed triquetrous, upper part scabrous, lower part smooth, with 4 or 5 bladeless sheaths at base; sheaths red-brown, usually splitting into reticulate fibers at lateral side. Leaves usually shorter than culm, rarely equaling culm, blades 2–3 mm wide, flat, verrucose on upper surface, margins scabrous. Lower involucral bracts leaflike, sheathed, involucral bracts at base of male spikes scalelike. Spikes 4–8; upper 3–6 male, contiguous at top of culm, subsessile; remaining spikes female, oblong or oblong-cylindric, 1.5–2.5 cm × 3–5 mm, loosely many flowered; peduncles slender. Female glumes stramineous, ovate-lanceolate or lanceolate, ca. 5 mm, 1-veined, margins white hyaline, apex acuminate. Utricles pale green, shorter than or equaling glume, narrowly ovate, ca. 4.5 mm, papery, obscurely 2-veined laterally on abaxial surface, base broadly cuneate, apex gradually narrowed to a long beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets loosely enveloped, obovate; style rather long; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. May–Jun.</description>

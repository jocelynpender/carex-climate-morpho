  <description>Rhizome slightly long, stoloniferous. Culms densely tufted, 15–25 cm tall, slender, trigonous, smooth, clothed with a few bladeless or shortly bladed sheaths at base. Leaves shorter than or nearly equaling culm, blades 1–2 mm wide, rather soft, flat, rather smooth proximally, scabrous distally and at margins, longest sheath ca. 3 cm. Involucral bracts shorter or longer than spike, lower blades leaflike, upper involucral bracts with setaceous blade, sheathed. Spikes 1–3, usually 2, single in an involucral bract sheath, distance between spikes 4–5 cm, androgynous, with male part longer than female part, many male flowers in upper part and loosely with few female flowers in lower part, cylindric, 1.5–3 cm; peduncles slender. Female glumes brownish yellow, narrowly oblong or oblong-lanceolate, ca. 5 mm, membranous, green 1-veined, apex acuminate, mucronate, sometimes aristate in basal glumes. Utricles greenish, suberect, shorter than glume, obovate, obtusely trigonous, ca. 3 mm, herbaceous, 2-veined laterally, whitish hispidulous on veins and margins, base broadly cuneate, apex abruptly contracted into a rather long beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets dark brown, tightly enveloped, obovate, obtusely trigonous, ca. 2 mm, base broadly cuneate, apex mucronate; style persistent, base thickened; stigmas 3, rather short, ca. 1 mm.</description>

  <description>Rhizome short, with slender stolons. Culms 30–50 cm tall, acutely triquetrous, scabrous on angles. Leaves longer than culm, blades 6–8 mm wide, slightly stiff, distinctly 2-veined laterally on upper surface, sheathed. Involucral bracts leaflike, longer than subtending spike, not sheathed. Spikes 3 or 4, rather congregate at top of culm, lowest spike slightly remote; terminal spike male, linear, 2–3 cm, sometimes with few female flowers at apex, shortly pedunculate; lateral spikes female, oblong or shortly cylindric, 1.5–2.5 cm, densely many flowered, nearly sessile. Male glumes pale, elliptic, ca. 3.8 mm, membranous, 1-veined, apex acuminate, mucronate; female glumes pale, green at middle, oblong or ovate-oblong, ca. 3 mm, membranous, 1-veined, apex acuminate, muticous or mucronate. Utricles stramineous, obliquely patent, nearly equaling glume, broadly obovate, obtusely trigonous, ca. 3 mm, glabrous, shiny, obscurely few veined, base obtusely rounded, apex abruptly contracted into a short beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets slightly loosely enveloped, subrhomboid, trigonous, ca. 1.5 mm; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 3, slender, persistent at fruiting stage.</description>

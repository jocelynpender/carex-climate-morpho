Culms 20–50 cm tall, triquetrous, rather slender, smooth on lower part and scabrid near top, clothed with red-brown and bladeless sheaths at base, one side of sheaths disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Leaves slightly longer than or equaling culm, blades 2–3 mm wide, stiff, longitudinally furrowed on costa, involute on margins, mid-sheathed. Involucral bracts leafy, lower involucral bracts longer than inflorescence, shortly sheathed, upper involucral bracts rather short, nearly not sheathed. Spikes 3–6; terminal 1–3 male, slightly contiguous, clavate, 1–2.5 cm, nearly sessile; remaining spikes female, remote, ovate or oblong, 1–3 × ca. 1 cm, slightly densely many flowered, pedunculate, peduncle less than 1 cm. Female glumes fuscous laterally, pale at middle, ovate or narrowly ovate, 4.5–5 mm, membranous, costate, apex acuminate, aristate. Utricles brown-green, obliquely patent, longer than glume (excluding awn), ovoid, slightly inflated trigonous, ca. 5 mm, leathery, glabrous, with several rather concave veins, base broadly cuneate, apex abruptly contracted into a slightly broad and short beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed, teeth straight, smooth. Nutlets broadly obovate or subelliptic, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, base stipitate, apex slightly long mucronate; style base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Apr–Jun.</description>

  <description>Rhizome stoloniferous. Culms 2 or 3 tufted at nodes of stolon, 30–60 cm tall, rather thin, trigonous, smooth, scabrid on upper part, clothed with red-brown and bladeless sheaths at base, rudimentary sheaths ± disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Leaves shorter than or upper ones slightly longer than culm, blades 2–3 mm wide, stiff, longitudinally furrowed on middle of upper surface, scabrous and slightly involute on margins, rather long sheathed. Lower involucral bracts leafy, longer than inflorescence, not sheathed, upper involucral bracts scalelike. Spikes 3–5; terminal 2 or 3 spikes male, approximate, narrowly cylindric, 1–3.5 cm, shortly pedunculate or nearly sessile; remaining spikes female, slightly remote, oblong or subovate, 1.5–2 × ca. 1 cm, densely 10–15-flowered, shortly pedunculate or upper ones nearly sessile. Female glumes brown, pale at middle, broadly ovate, 5–6 mm, membranous, 3-veined, apex acuminate, mucronate. Utricles brown, obliquely patent, longer than glume, oblong-elliptic, inflated trigonous, 6–8.5 mm, subcorky, glabrous, slightly concave, several veined, base obtuse, apex abruptly narrowed to a slightly broad and short beak, orifice half-moon-shaped concave and shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets brown, tightly enveloped, oblong or narrowly oblong, obtusely trigonous, 4–5.5 mm; style base slightly thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Apr–Jul.</description>

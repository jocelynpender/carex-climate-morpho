  <description>Rhizome very short, ligneous. Culms densely tufted, 25–50 cm tall, obtusely trigonous, smooth, clothed with bladeless sheaths at base. Leaves many, nearly basal, shorter or slightly longer than culm, blades 3–8 mm wide, stiff, smooth on both surfaces, scabrous on upper margins, margins revolute; sheaths 3.5–8 cm, eventually splitting. Involucral bracts leaflike, surpassing subtending spikes, sheathed. Spikes numerous, usually 5–9 borne in an involucral bract sheath, sometimes ramose and disposed in a panicle, androgynous, female part and male part subequal or female part slightly longer, oblong or oblong-cylindric, sometimes narrowly ovate, 10–25 × ca. 5 mm, densely many flowered; lower peduncles slender, upper rather short. Female glumes pale yellow, ovate-lanceolate, ca. 4 mm, mem- branous, 1–3-veined, margins white hyaline, apex attenuate, mucronate or muticous. Utricles yellowish green, nearly horizontally patent or obliquely patent at maturity, shorter than or equaling glume, elliptic or ovate-elliptic, trigonous, ca. 3.5 mm, membranous, glabrous, 5-veined, 2 lateral veins distinct and others inconspicuous, base subrounded, estipitate, apex attenuate into a ± long beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed.

  <description>Rhizome oblique, woody, rigid. Culms 50–60 cm tall, trigonous, stiff, scabrous above, clothed at base with dark brown sheaths disintegrating into fibers. Leaves surpassing culm, blades broadly linear, 0.8–1.1 cm wide, leathery, flat, revolute, upper margins scabrous, apex acuminate. Involucral bracts leaflike, shorter than inflorescence, sheathing. Spikes numerous; terminal spike male or androgynous (male part equaling female part or 1/3–1/2 length of spike), cylindric, 3–11 × 7–11 mm, densely flowered, shortly pedunculate. Female glumes red-brown, ovate, much narrowed, margins white hyaline, green 3-veined costa excurrent into a mucro. Utricles longer than glume, obliquely patent, ovate-lanceolate, 6–6.5 mm (including beak), leathery, glabrous, faintly many veined, base cuneate, apex abruptly contracted into a cylindric long beak ca. 4 mm, beak scabrous on margins, orifice deeply 2-lobed with divergent teeth. Nutlets yellow-brown, tightly enveloped, elliptic, 3–3.5 mm (including beak), trigonous with angles constricted at middle, faces concave both at apex and base, base with short curved stipe, apex abruptly contracted into a beak 1–1.5 mm; style base hardly thickened; stigmas 3.

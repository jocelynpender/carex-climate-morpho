  <description>Rhizome short, woody, oblique. Culms densely tufted, 10–22 cm tall, slender, compressed trigonous, slightly scabrous, clothed at base with light brown sheaths eventually disintegrating into parallel fibers. Leaves equaling or shorter than culm, blades linear, 1–2 mm wide, flattish, sometimes involute, margins scabrous, apex acuminate. Lower involucral bracts leaflike, shorter than inflorescence, sheathing 1–2 mm, upper involucral bracts glumelike. Spikes 3–7; terminal spike gynaecandrous, rarely male, clavate, 1.4–1.8 cm; remaining spikes female, cylindric, 1–2 cm, upper 1 or 2 approximate, sessile or subsessile, lowest spike slightly distant, with long peduncle. Female glumes purple-brown, elliptic-ovate, 2.5–3.5 mm, margins white hyaline, yellow-green 1-veined costa excurrent into a mucro, apex acute. Utricles yellow-green or purple-brown at apex, longer than glume, oblong-lanceolate, compressed trigonous, 4–5.5 mm, membranous, hirsute, faintly veined, base cuneate, margins scabrous, apex gradually attenuate into a beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets light brown, loosely enveloped, oblong, compressed trigonous, 2–2.5 mm, base with stipe ca. 1 mm; style erect, base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Jul–Aug.</description>

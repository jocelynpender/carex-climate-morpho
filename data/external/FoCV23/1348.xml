Leaves longer than culm, blades 7–14 mm wide, flat, distinctly 2-veined laterally, purple-red sheathed. Involucral bracts leaflike, lower involucral bracts longer than subtending spike, slightly long sheathed, upper involucral bracts rather narrow and shorter than subtending spike, shortly sheathed. Spikes 5–8, lower spikes remote, upper spikes approximate; terminal 1 or 2 spikes male, sublinear, 2.5–4 cm, pedunculate; remaining spikes female, sometimes with few male flowers at base, cylindric, 2.5–5.5 cm, densely many flowered, lower spikes rather long pedunculate, upper spikes shortly pedunculate. Male glumes brownish red, lanceolate, ca. 6 mm, 1-veined, apex acute; female glumes brownish red, lanceolate-ovate or lanceolate, 3–4 mm, membranous, 1-veined, apex acuminate or acute, mucronate. Utricles green or yellowish green, obliquely patent, longer than glume, obovate-oblong, inflated trigonous, ca. 4 mm, herbaceous, glabrous, several veined, base cuneate, apex abruptly contracted into a rather short beak, orifice 2-toothed. Nutlets gray-green, brownish yellow on angles, rather loosely enveloped, elliptic, trigonous, ca. 2 mm; style base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. May–Jul.</description>

  <description>Rhizome with long stolons. Culms 20–40 cm tall, triquetrous, smooth on lower part, scabrid on upper part, clothed with red-brown and bladeless sheaths at base, rudimentary sheaths usually disintegrating into fibers. Leaves shorter than culm, blades 2–3 mm wide, flat, ± stiff, scabrous on margins, slightly long sheathed. Involucral bracts awn-shaped, usually shorter than spike, sometimes lowermost slightly longer than spike, not sheathed or lowermost one shortly sheathed. Spikes 3 or 4, congregate on top of culm; terminal 1 or 2 spikes male, oblong or clavate, 1–3 cm, sessile; remaining spikes female, ovate or oblong, 0.8–1.8 cm, densely many flowered, nearly sessile, sometimes lowermost one very shortly pedunculate. Female glumes brown laterally, yellowish brown at middle, orbicular-ovate or ovate, ca. 3.5 mm, membranous, 3-veined, green costate, margins white hyaline, sometimes upper margin erose, apex acute, mucronate. Utricles brown, obliquely patent, slightly longer than glume, broadly ovate or ovoid, obtusely trigonous, 3–4 mm, leathery, glabrous, slightly shiny, indistinctly veined, base subrounded, apex abruptly narrowed to a slightly broad and short beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed. Nutlets rather tightly enveloped in utricle, broadly obovate or broadly elliptic, trigonous, ca. 2.8 mm, base shortly stipitate, apex mucronate; style base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr.

  <description>Rhizome stoloniferous. Culms 60–70 cm tall, subrigid, scabrous above, clothed at base with brown sheaths. Leaves shorter than culm, blades linear, 3–4 mm wide, flat, slightly soft. Lower involucral bracts subleafy, sheathless, upper ones glumelike. Spikes 5–7, contiguous, lowest spike much spaced, cylindric, 25–36 × 6–7 mm, densely flowered, upper 3 or 4 male (rarely with a few female flowers at base), remaining spikes female, usually with a few male flowers at apex; peduncles slender, with dense papillae, upper ones rather short. Female glumes dark purple or brown, oblong-lanceolate, 4–4.5 mm, margins white hyaline, 1-veined green costa ending in a mucro at apex. Utricles pale brown, shorter than glume, subrounded or broadly ovate, compressed trigonous, 2.3–2.5 mm, purple punctate, glabrous, nerveless, apex abruptly contracted into a very short beak, orifice hyaline and emarginate. Nutlets loosely enveloped, elliptic, base abruptly contracted into short stipe; style base not thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. Jul–Aug.</description>

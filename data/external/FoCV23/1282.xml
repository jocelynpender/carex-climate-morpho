  <discussion>This name was originally published by N. R. Cui (Fl. Xinjiang. 6: 435, 604. 1996, “kunlunsannsis”), where the type was indicated as having been collected in Ruoqiang Xian and deposited in three herbaria in Xinjiang (XJA, XJBI, XJNU). However, because no collector’s name, number, or date was cited, the requirements of Vienna Code Art. 37 were not satisfied and consequently the name was not validly published there. The name was validated by S. Y. Jin and Y. L. Chen by full and direct reference to N. R. Cui’s validating Latin description and indication of the holotype at XJNU.</discussion>

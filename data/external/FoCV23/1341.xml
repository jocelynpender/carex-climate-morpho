  <description>Rhizome rather thick and short, ligneous, with elongate and rather thick stolons. Culms loosely tufted, 45–95 cm tall, acutely triquetrous, slightly scabrous on angles, densely with many leaves at base. Leaves longer than culm, blades 8–18 mm wide, flat, with 2 distinct lateral veins, smooth on both surfaces, scabrous on margins, sheathed, basal sheaths usually dehiscent. Involucral bracts leaflike, longer than subtending spike, very shortly sheathed or nearly not sheathed. Spikes 5–7, usually congregate at top of culm; uppermost 1 or 2 spikes male, cylindric or narrowly cylindric, 3–7 cm, shortly pedunculate or nearly sessile; remaining spikes female, sometimes with few male flowers at apex, cylindric, 5–10 cm, lowermost spike sometimes with rather long peduncle, upper spikes with much shorter peduncle or nearly sessile. Female glumes at base of spike subovate, ca. 8.5 mm (including ca. 5 mm awn), apex with long awn, upper glumes oblong-lanceolate, 4–5 mm, apex attenuate or truncate, with a short awn or mucro, ferruginous, membranous, 1–3-veined. Utricles dark brown-green, nearly equaling glume, shorter than glume at base of spike, nearly horizontally patent at maturity, ovate, broadly ovate, or subobovate, inflated trigonous, ca. 4 mm, membranous, glabrous, several veined, transversely rugose and several tuberculate between veins, base broadly cuneate, apex abruptly contracted into a medium-sized to long or rather short beak, beak recurved, emarginate or shortly 2-toothed at orifice. Nutlets yellowish brown, rather loosely enveloped, elliptic or subobovate, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, densely tuberculate on surface, base very shortly stipitate, apex with recurved mucro; stigmas 3.</description>

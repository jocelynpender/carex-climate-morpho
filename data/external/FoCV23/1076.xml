  <description>Rhizome stoloniferous, stolons slender. Culms loosely tufted, 30–70 cm tall, acutely triquetrous, smooth on lower part, scabrous on angles of upper part, purple-brown and bladeless sheathed at base, sheaths disintegrating into reticulate fibers. Leaves slightly shorter than culm, blades 2–3 mm wide, flat or conduplicate at lower part, slightly revolute when dry, slightly stiff, red-brown and rather long sheathed. Involucral bracts leaflike, linear, slightly shorter than inflorescence, not sheathed. Spikes 3 or 4, rather remote; uppermost 1 or 2 spikes male, narrowly oblong or lanceolate, (1–)2–3 cm, subsessile; female spikes 2 or 3, oblong or ovoid, 0.8–2 cm, densely many flow-ered, lowermost one very shortly pedunculate, others sessile. Female glumes dark red-brown laterally, brownish at middle, ovate or oblong-ovate, ca. 3 mm, membranous, 1-veined, apex acute or acuminate, sometimes mucronate. Utricles greenish brown, obliquely patent, equaling or slightly longer than glume, elliptic or subovate, slightly inflated trigonous, 2.5–3 mm, subleathery, glabrous, papillose, distinctly several veined, base abruptly contracted into a short stipe, apex abruptly narrowed into a short beak, orifice emarginate, slightly purple-brown. Nutlets stramineous, subloosely enveloped, broadly obovate, trigonous, ca. 2 mm, base broadly truncate, apex mucronate; style base thickened; stigmas 3. Fl. and fr. May–Jun.</description>

Upper leaves longer than culms, blades 5–9 mm wide, flat, scabrous on both surfaces and margins, sheathed, sheaths 2–7 cm, lower ones rather long, upper ones short. Involucral bracts leaflike, longer than inflorescence, sheathed. Spikes 5 or 6, upper spikes slightly approximate, lower spikes slightly remote; terminal spike male, linear, 2–2.5 cm, shortly pedunculate; lateral spikes female, oblong or narrowly cylindric, 1.5–4 cm, laxly 10–30-flowered, rather long pedunculate, greater part of peduncles clothed in involucral bract sheaths. Female glumes stramineous laterally, shortly ferruginous striate, ovate or broadly ovate, ca. 2.5 mm, membranous, green 1-costate, apex acute. Utricles yellowish green, ferruginous punctate, suberect, longer than glume, obovate, trigonous, 3–3.5 mm, membranous, distinctly 2-veined laterally, hispidulous on lateral veins and upper margins, base gradually narrowed, shortly stipitate, apex abruptly contracted into a slightly long beak, orifice shortly 2-toothed.
